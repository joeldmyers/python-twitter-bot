# python-twitter-bot
This is a twitter bot that auto-replies to specific phrases other people say on the internet.  It violates the terms of service of Twitter, so use it fast and enjoy!


This was made for a certain band's project and was short-lived and did its thing.

If you want a straight twitter bot that won't get flagged by Twitter, 
just take out the part that is replying to other people's handles; you're perfectly free to tweet all you want.  

Also check out the GlissantBot I set up at twitter.com/glissantbot

part of the Villa Empain exhibition spring 17.
